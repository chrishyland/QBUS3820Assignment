Hi Rowena!
You can check out the analysis.py code to see the models I've fitted so far. They seem to be quite strong in terms of performance already.
If you could, could you fork a new branch in the repository and extend on the analysis notebook. We can then later merge them!

Tasks I'd like you to do:
- EDAs
  - Check for skewness
  - Check for outliers and remove accordingly
  - Check for interactions
- Feature Engineering
- Run through my code to make sure the variables I'm running on my models are correct (my models seems to be performing too well)
